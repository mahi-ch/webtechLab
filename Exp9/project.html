        <h4> Short Description about NLP ChatBot</h4> 
        <p>NLP chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot that enables humans to have natural conversations with a machine and get the results they are looking for in as few steps as possible. This type of chatbot uses natural language processing techniques to make conversations human-like.  </p> <br>
        <p>NLP is based on the deep learning concept that empowers the machine (in this case, chatbot) to decode the meaning from the input and respond to the user. The NLP engine uses natural language understanding to analyse the utterance (user query) and derive the intent to identify what the user wants the machine to do. Using natural language generation (NLG), the machine then responds to the user in a language that the user can understand. </p>
